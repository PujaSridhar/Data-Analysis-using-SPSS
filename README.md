## Correlation Analysis

### Steps to Find Correlation Scores and Significance Values in SPSS

1. **Open SPSS** and load your dataset.
2. **Correlation Scores**:
    - Go to `Analyze` > `Correlate` > `Bivariate...`.
    - Select the variables you want to correlate (e.g., `Adult Mortality` and `Life Expectancy`).
    - Ensure that the `Pearson` checkbox is selected.
    - Click `OK`.
3. **Significance Values**:
    - The output window will display the correlation coefficients (r) and the significance values (p).
    - Check the p-values to determine statistical significance. If p < 0.05, the correlation is statistically significant.
4. **Correlation Directions**:
    - Look at the sign of the correlation coefficients. A negative sign indicates a negative direction, and a positive sign indicates a positive direction.
